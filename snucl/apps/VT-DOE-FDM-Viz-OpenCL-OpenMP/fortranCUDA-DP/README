This code does computations in double precision on GPU

Prerequisites:
1) CUDA Toolkit version >4.0
2) MPI library with fortran bindings

Steps:
1) In the Makefile, set the following environment variables to appropriate compilers
MPIF90, MPICC , FF90 , CC

2) In the Makefile, set the following environment variables to MPI installation and CUDA toolkit installation directories respectively:
MPI_DIR, CUDA_DIR

3) Running 'make' should compile the code

4) mpirun -np X ./disfd # would launch simulation with X processes
